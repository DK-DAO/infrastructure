## Hi Auditor

That's great to see you here there are some notes:

- Please ignore following folder `contracts/dao/`, `contracts/test` these files won't be used in the near future, please avoid to count them in your estimation.
- `contracts/libraries/ERC20.sol` and `contracts/libraries/ERC721.sol` were cloned from [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)
- The code is under development, there are some tiny updates. If you begin the audit please let us know when will you start.

Thank you <3
